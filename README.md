<h1>Norb's Fractallizer</h1>

<p><b>This thing is heavily in development and is very slow because boost::multiprecision and
basically zero plotting algo optimizations :)</b></p>

<p>
Have you ever wanted to easily create those very funky acid trip looking videos that zoom
into the famous Mandelbrot Set fractal?
<br>
Well, Fractallizer lets you do just that! Just set the resolution, zoom depth, zoom time and center around a given
point and then give it a sec and tada! Your video is done. No hassle.
